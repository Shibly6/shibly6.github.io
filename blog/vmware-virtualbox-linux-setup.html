            <p>
                According to StatCounter, over 69% of desktop users worldwide run Windows. But if you're serious about
                breaking into <strong>cybersecurity, cloud computing, server management, or DevOps</strong>, Linux is
                not optional — it's inevitable. At some point, whether from day one or somewhere along the way, you
                will need to work with Linux.
            </p>

            <p>
                For most people, completely abandoning Windows for Linux overnight isn't realistic. That's where
                <strong>virtualization</strong> comes in. Tools like <strong>VMware Workstation Pro</strong> and
                <strong>VirtualBox</strong> let you run a fully isolated Linux environment inside Windows, so you can
                learn at your own pace without disrupting your daily workflow.
            </p>

            <div class="alert info">
                <strong>ℹ️ Note:</strong> Both VMware Workstation Pro and VirtualBox are free for personal use. This
                guide covers how to download and set up both so you can choose the one that works best for you.
            </div>

            <h2>Downloading VMware Workstation Pro</h2>

            <p>
                In 2023, Broadcom acquired VMware and subsequently shifted its business model — moving away from retail
                software sales toward high-value enterprise subscriptions. As a result, VMware Workstation Pro is now
                <strong>free for personal use</strong>, but the download process requires a Broadcom account. Here's
                how to get it.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 1: Create or Log In to Your Broadcom Account</h3>
            <p>
                If you already have a Broadcom account, head over to the
                <strong><a href="https://access.broadcom.com/default/ui/v1/signin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broadcom
                    login page</a></strong>. If not, <strong><a href="https://profile.broadcom.com/web/registration" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">register here</a></strong> first, then log in.
            </p>

            <p>Once logged in, you'll be greeted with the Broadcom dashboard:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/vmware-virtualbox-linux-setup/01-broadcom-dashboard.png"
                    alt="Broadcom dashboard after login showing the main navigation panel">
                <figcaption>// Figure 1: Broadcom dashboard after successful login</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Step 2: Navigate to My Downloads</h3>
            <p>
                Click on <strong>My Downloads</strong> in the left sidebar. This section gives you access to all
                software available under your account, including the free personal-use tools.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/vmware-virtualbox-linux-setup/02-my-downloads-section.png"
                    alt="Broadcom My Downloads section in the left navigation panel">
                <figcaption>// Figure 2: My Downloads section in the Broadcom portal</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Step 3: Access Free Software</h3>
            <p>
                Look for the option to view Broadcom's free software offerings and click it. You'll see a list of
                available tools at no cost:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/vmware-virtualbox-linux-setup/03-broadcom-free-software-list.png"
                    alt="Broadcom free software list showing VMware Workstation Pro and other tools">
                <figcaption>// Figure 3: Broadcom free software list</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Step 4: Select VMware Workstation Pro</h3>
            <p>
                From the list, select <strong>VMware Workstation Pro</strong>. You'll then be prompted to choose a
                version.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/vmware-virtualbox-linux-setup/04-vmware-version-selection.png"
                    alt="VMware Workstation Pro version selection screen showing 17.5.x and 25H2 options">
                <figcaption>// Figure 4: VMware version selection</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <div class="alert warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Which version should you pick?</strong> VMware <strong>25H2</strong> is the latest release
                and includes hardware support for newer processors (Intel Lunar Lake, Arrow Lake), but it has several
                known bugs. <strong>Version 17.6.x</strong> is the stable, battle-tested choice for everyday use. If
                you don't specifically need the latest hardware support, stick with 17.6.x.
            </div>

            <p>
                For reliability, I went with version 17. Here's what the download screen looks like:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/vmware-virtualbox-linux-setup/05-vmware-download-screen.png"

                <figcaption>// Figure 5: VMware Workstation Pro 17 download screen</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Step 5: Accept the Terms and Conditions</h3>
            <p>
                Click the <strong>Terms and Conditions</strong> link to open the agreement — this action also enables
                the checkbox so you can actually agree to it. Once you've read and accepted, you'll be prompted to
                confirm:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/vmware-virtualbox-linux-setup/06-terms-and-conditions.png"

                <figcaption>// Figure 6: Accepting the terms and conditions</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to proceed.</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>// Figure 7: Confirming the agreement</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Step 6: Fill in the Compliance Form</h3>
            <p>
                Broadcom requires a short compliance form before allowing the download. Fill it out accurately:
            </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>// Figure 8: Compliance form</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Step 7: Download the Installer</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, click the <strong>Download</strong> button to grab the installer:
            </p>

            <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid var(--border); margin: 3rem 0;">

            <h2>Downloading VirtualBox</h2>

            <p>
                If Broadcom's multi-step process felt like a bit much, you'll appreciate Oracle's approach with
                VirtualBox. No accounts, no compliance forms, no friction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply visit the official
                <strong><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">VirtualBox Downloads page</a></strong>
                and click the link that matches your operating system. That's it.

            <h2>VMware vs VirtualBox: Which Should You Choose?</h2>

            <p>
                The popular YouTuber <strong>NetworkChuck</strong> frequently recommends VMware Workstation Pro as the
                top pick for performance — especially now that it's free for personal use. He uses it regularly in his
                tutorials because it tends to handle heavier workloads and 3D acceleration more efficiently than
                VirtualBox.
            </p>

            <p>
                That said, in my personal experience, the difference in day-to-day usage isn't dramatic. For learning
                Linux, running CTF environments, or basic lab work, both tools get the job done well. Here's a quick
                breakdown:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>VMware Workstation Pro</strong> — Better performance for heavy workloads, smoother 3D
                    support, more polished UI. Slightly more complex to download (Broadcom account required).</li>
                <li><strong>VirtualBox</strong> — Open-source, dead simple to install, cross-platform, and perfect for
                    most learning scenarios. Oracle's download is hassle-free.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert info">
                <strong>ℹ️ My Take:</strong> Start with whichever you can get running faster. Both are excellent for
                learning. You can always switch later once you know what you actually need.
            </div>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you're stepping into cybersecurity, DevOps, or cloud computing, having a Linux environment
                ready on your Windows machine is an essential first step. VMware Workstation Pro and VirtualBox both
                give you a safe, isolated space to experiment — without touching your main system. The download process
                for VMware is a bit involved thanks to Broadcom's portal, but once you're through it, you've got a
                powerful tool at your disposal for free. VirtualBox remains the no-hassle alternative that's more than
                capable for most use cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a follow-up post, I'll walk through actually installing a Linux distro (like Ubuntu or Kali) inside
                one of these hypervisors. Stay tuned.
