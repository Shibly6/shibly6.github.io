    <main class="section">
        <article class="post-content">
            <p>
                The day before Eid, around noon — we had just finished lunch and were resting. Suddenly, a close family
                friend who works as a marketing officer for a large steel rod company came to me, visibly shaken. He
                told me someone had called him on WhatsApp, claiming to be a police officer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The caller said: <em>"There's a WhatsApp group where people are saying bad things about you and other
                    officers. I'll add you to the group and give you the password — you can see the proof
                    yourself!"</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                This frightened him immediately — and the scammer sensed that fear and exploited it. Using this
                fear-inducing tactic, they successfully hacked his WhatsApp account.
            </p>

            <div class="clearfix">
                <figure class="img-float-left">
                    <img src="assets/images/scammer-experience/1747280580555.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Scam Warning">
                    <figcaption>// Be aware of fake police scams on WhatsApp</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h2>The Psychological Pressure Intensifies</h2>

                <p>
                    After gaining access, the scammer moved to the second phase — applying psychological pressure:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Your location is being tracked."</li>
                    <li>"A police team has been dispatched."</li>
                    <li>"If you don't want to get caught, turn off your phone right now."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Then they gave him another number and told him to call it immediately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this point, the victim started to suspect something was wrong and came to me. I was in deep sleep
                    at the time and couldn't fully process what was happening. Just then, the scammer called again!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I picked up the phone, still half-asleep, and asked: <strong>"Where exactly are you seeing my
                        location?"</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The moment I asked that question, the scammer went silent and immediately hung up. Right after that,
                    we noticed messages being sent from his WhatsApp account asking contacts for money!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="alert danger">
                <strong>🚨 Critical Moment:</strong> Despite the terrifying situation, we were lucky that he became
                suspicious in time — and that's when we managed to regain control.
            </div>

            <h2>How I Confirmed It Was a Scam</h2>

            <p>
                Before I even answered the phone, I checked the number on Truecaller. It clearly showed: <strong>"Fake
                    Police Scammer"</strong> — already reported by others.
            </p>

            <h2>Lessons from This Experience</h2>

            <p>
                Here are some crucial takeaways to protect yourself:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Don't Panic</h3>
            <p>
                Scammers rely on creating <strong>panic</strong> to force you into making bad decisions. Stay calm and
                think logically.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Never Trust Without Verification</h3>
            <p>
                Don't believe anyone who claims to be from "Police," "CID," or "Cyber Team" without proper verification
                through official channels.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Enable Two-Step Verification on WhatsApp</h3>
            <p>
                Go to: <code>Settings > Account > Two-step verification</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                This adds an extra layer of security that makes it much harder for scammers to hijack your account.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Check Linked Devices Regularly</h3>
            <p>
                Go to: <code>WhatsApp > Linked Devices</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Check regularly to see if someone has opened your account on another device without your knowledge.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Use Truecaller to Verify Unknown Numbers</h3>
            <p>
                Many scam numbers are already reported by previous victims. A quick Truecaller check can save you from
                falling into the trap.
            </p>

            <h3>6. The Golden Rule</h3>
            <blockquote>
                "Do the opposite of what the scammer tells you to do!"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                If they say "turn off your phone immediately," that's exactly when you should <strong>stay online and
                    verify</strong> everything.
            </p>

            <h2>Red Flags to Watch Out For</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Unsolicited calls from "police" or "government officials"</li>
                <li>Pressure to act immediately without time to think</li>
                <li>Requests for passwords, OTPs, or personal information</li>
                <li>Threats of arrest or legal action over the phone</li>
                <li>Being asked to download apps or click suspicious links</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Remember:</strong> Real law enforcement agencies will NEVER ask for passwords, OTPs, or
                threaten you over WhatsApp calls. They follow proper legal procedures.
            </div>

            <h2>What to Do If You're Targeted</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Stay calm</strong> — don't let fear cloud your judgment</li>
                <li><strong>Verify the caller's identity</strong> through official channels</li>
                <li><strong>Don't share any personal information</strong> or passwords</li>
                <li><strong>Check the number on Truecaller</strong> or similar services</li>
                <li><strong>Report the number</strong> to local cybercrime units</li>
                <li><strong>Warn your contacts</strong> if your account gets compromised</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                Cybercriminals are getting more sophisticated every day, using psychological manipulation and social
                engineering to exploit people's fears. The best defense is awareness and a healthy dose of skepticism.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember: <strong>Real authorities don't operate through WhatsApp threats.</strong> If something feels
                off, it probably is. Trust your instincts, verify everything, and never let fear rush you into making
                decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Stay safe out there, and share this with your friends and family — awareness is our strongest weapon
                against scammers.
            </p>
